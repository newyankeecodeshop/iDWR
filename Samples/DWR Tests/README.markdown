# DWR Tests

This sample shows how to setup and use iDWR. It uses two of the services provided in the dwr.war that you can get from the DWR distribution, "Demo" and "People".

## Setup

1. Download dwr.war from <http://directwebremoting.org/dwr/downloads/index.html>. This was tested with DWR 2.0.6, but I think it will work with 3.0 rc1.

2. Install the .war on Tomcat or your favorite servlet container.

3. Start the server.

4. Build and Run DWR Tests. The first tab mimics the "Dynamic Text" demo in the WAR, and the second mimics the "Editable Table" demo.
